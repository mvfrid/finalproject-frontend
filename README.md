# Technigo Final Project - OdysseyIntroduction
This is a website where you can find and gather inspiration for traveling. It’s like a mashup between Pinterest and TripAdvisor. By enabling Google Places API we enable users to find information about places all over the world. Users can specify what category of place they’re looking for, for example restaurants, points of interest or accommodation.  
  
To make the application into a personalized board users can then create their own trips and to those trips add all the places that they would like to remember in the future.  
  
In a user's profile they can scroll through their collections of created trips, click to go to a single trip and see all of the places that they have saved. In the saved places users can also write their own reviews and rate those places to be saved to their own trips.
